Why Rust?

I have decided to learn and use Rust.

Why?

It comes highly reccomended by noboilerplate.

  And that right there might be reason enough. But I'll go on.

I was frustrated with Python for a few reasons.

- I want to make a music-generating Discord bot that responds to text prompts in the server and creates original music.
- I developed a basic proof of concept in Python, but had some difficulties.
- I started out using interactions.py, until I realized that it doesn't handle audio. Then I was unsure whether to use discord.py or pycord. I used discord.py by default in my proof of concept, but I wasn't sure it was the best choice.

I believe Rust will be efficient and effective for real-time audio processing.

  I'm excited to learn about audio processing in Rust.
